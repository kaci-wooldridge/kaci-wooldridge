# Hello friends! 🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Kaci.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer who recently graduated from the full-stack bootcamp at Nashville Software School. I'm excited to showcase my projects and collaborate with fellow developers.✨

## 🔭 What I'm currently up to

I'm currently leveling up my skills by working on various personal projects. I enjoy building web applications using technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React and Node.js. I'm also delving into backend development with languages like Sql and C#/.NET. 🌈🚀

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning

Learning is a never-ending adventure, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge. Currently, I'm diving deeper into exciting topics such as:

- Advanced JavaScript concepts and clever design patterns
- Exploring data structures and algorithms (because who doesn't love solving puzzles? 🧩)
- Exploring testing methodologies and trying out cool frameworks
- Embracing cloud computing and smart deployment strategies

## 💼 My experience so far

During my time at Nashville Software School, I had a blast building full-stack web applications! From brainstorming ideas to delivering awesome features, I soaked up the whole software development experience. Problem-solving is my jam, and I can totally rock it with my mad skills. Plus, I'm a great communicator and love working in teams! 👩🏼‍🤝‍👩🏽
